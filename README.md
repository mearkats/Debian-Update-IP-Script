# Update IP Address - Debian 11/12

![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/Build-Passing-Success) ![Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-PowerShell-blue)

Hello and welcome!
This script allows the user to update the IP address of a Debian Linux machine. I recently found myself in need of something that I could just download and run to change the IP address of a Debian VM. I create a lot of development debian VMs and needed something quick and easy :)

If you would like to learn more on how this script works, please don't hesitate to contact me via [email](mailto:david@mearkats.co.uk) and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!

If this script helped you, please give it a star to show your appreciation.
